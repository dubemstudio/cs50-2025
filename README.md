# 💻 CS50: Introduction to Computer Science | My Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the problem sets from **Harvard's CS50** course. Each program is written in **C**, thoughtfully structured, cleanly commented, and progressively improved as I deepen my understanding.

> ✅ **Completed:** Week 0 - Week 3
> 🔄 Ongoing refinement as I continue through the course

## ⚙️ How to Compile & Run

You can compile each `.c` file using `clang` or the CS50 `make` utility.

### Using `clang`:

```bash
clang filename.c -o output
./output
```

### Using `make`:

```bash
make filename
./filename
```

> Example:

```bash
make credit
./credit
```

## 📚 Learning Note

All solutions were built from scratch as part of my learning journey through the CS50 curriculum. They're written with clarity and understanding in mind. If you're also taking CS50, feel free to explore this repo for reference — but avoid copying. You'll learn more by struggling a little :)

## 🙌 Credits

* Thanks to [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu) and Professor David J. Malan for the incredible course.
* Gratitude to the CS50 community and open-source contributors for sharing knowledge and motivation 🙏
