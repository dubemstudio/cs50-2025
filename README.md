# 💻 CS50: Introduction to Computer Science — My Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the problem sets from **Harvard's CS50** course. Each program is written in C and structured for clarity, learning, and future reference. Thoughtfully commented, clean, and progressively improved as I deepen my understanding.

> ✅ **Completed:** Week 1 & Week 2  
> 📅 Ongoing refinement as I move through the course

## ⚙️ How to Compile & Run

You can compile each `.c` file using `clang` or the CS50 `make` utility.

### Using `clang`:
```bash
clang credit.c -o credit
./credit
```

### Using `make`:
```bash
make credit
./credit
```

## 📚 Learning Note

All solutions here were built from scratch as part of my journey through the CS50 curriculum. They're written to be easy to read, understand, and learn from. If you're also taking CS50, use this repo for reference and study—not for copying.
